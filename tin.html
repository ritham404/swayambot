Step one: equip \nyourself with your ID, proof of address, and maybe a bit of patience. Next, head to the designated portal on your platform of choice. There, you'll face some verification quests: filling out forms, snapping selfies, maybe even uploading those documents. Conquer these, and the gatekeeper AI will grant you access! \nRemember, each platform might have its own unique questline, so check their instructions for the most epic KYC victory.")
